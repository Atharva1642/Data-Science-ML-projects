# Boston Housing Model

This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts housing prices in Boston based on various features.

## Description

The Boston Housing Model is a predictive model built using machine learning techniques. It is trained on the Boston Housing Dataset, which includes various features such as per capita crime rate, average number of rooms per dwelling, pupil-teacher ratio by town, etc. The model is trained to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes in Boston suburbs.

## Contents

- `boston_housing_model.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `data/`: Folder containing the Boston Housing Dataset used for training the model.
- `saved_model/`: Folder containing the serialized trained model.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc. (See `requirements.txt` for details)



Run the Jupyter Notebook `boston_housing_model.ipynb` to train the model, perform analysis, and make predictions.

## Model Evaluation

The model's performance metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE), R-squared value, etc., are included in the notebook. The model's predictions can be evaluated based on these metrics.
